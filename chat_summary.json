The user further requested a field with \"neon,\" which the AI also acknowledged and offered additional features like color customization and a dynamic preview of uniforms. The conversation continued with the user asking for a \"Teio\" field, for which various potential features were suggested, including form validation and placeholder text.\n\nThe user further proposed adding buttons labeled \"Eyes\" and \"Free,\" both of which the AI confirmed it would work on. The user then requested a \"Forget Password\" field, which led to additional inquiries about its functionality. Following this, the user specified the need for a form with email and password capabilities. Each of the user's requests prompted the AI to confirm completion and present related features, such as a password strength meter and email verification system.\n\nFinally, the user requested buttons for categories involving \"Socks,\" \"Shirts,\" and \"Tie's,\" for which the AI also acknowledged and sought clarity on the project's overall scope. Throughout the interaction, the assistant maintained a collaborative tone, confirming each request and thoughtfully following up with relevant options for the user to consider.",
