The user also discussed the layout and functionality of buttons, including positioning them on the main screen or specific sections, and their respective functionalities. The AI provided options for additional features the user might want to implement, such as a color picker, interactive sizing guide, and feedback mechanisms, confirming the inclusion of various requested features like a price display, favorites button, and dynamic search functionality. \n\nThe user made requests for functional buttons, such as a \"Forget Password\" field and email/password form, with the AI confirming tasks for each. Additional functionality was discussed, including a password strength meter and email verification system to enhance security. The conversation concludes with the assistant asking for further details about the project to refine the user\u2019s requests.",
