The assistant continued to suggest additional UI elements, such as a \"Forget Everything\" field and various interactive features. The user made further requests, specifically asking for buttons labeled \"Eyes,\" \"Free,\" and a \"Forget Password.\" Each time, the AI acknowledged the requests and provided clarification through follow-up questions.\n\nEventually, the user requested a form for email and password registration, which was also acknowledged by the AI. The user continued to iterate on various features, including buttons for category navigation and customization options. Throughout the conversation, the AI consistently asked questions for clarification and offered additional features for consideration before confirming the implementation of each requested item.",
