The user requested the addition of a text field labeled \"Forget Password,\" which the AI acknowledged. They were also presented with options regarding the placement of this feature within the app and whether to include security questions or an email reset link. The user later asked for a form that includes fields for email and password, to which the AI confirmed it would be added. \n\nAdditionally, the AI provided a checklist of potential features, such as a password strength meter, email verification, and a \"Forgot password?\" link, highlighting what has been checked off. The user confirmed the need for buttons labeled \"Socks,\" \"Shirts,\" and \"Tie's\" as well as an implementation of these buttons. The user was also queried about the positioning of the \"Tie's\" button and the action that should occur upon clicking it. The AI again acknowledged this request, indicating progress on adding the required functionalities. Throughout the conversation, the AI continuously adapted based on the user's inputs and preferences.",
