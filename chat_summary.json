The AI confirmed the inclusion of several features while noting others remained unchecked.\n\nSubsequently, the user requested to add a button labeled \"Tie's,\" prompting the AI to inquire about the button's position and associated actions within the app. The user was given options for where to place the button and what it should do when clicked. The AI acknowledged this new request and confirmed it would proceed with adding the \"Tie's\" button. To gain more context, the AI then asked the user to describe the project further.",
